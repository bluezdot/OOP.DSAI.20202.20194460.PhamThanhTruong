If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Ans: - This is not a valid method overloading example. This will throw compilation error.
     - 2 constructor method above both have argument type of String. So when we create a DVD like
DigitalVideoDisc("Aladin"), this is an ambiguity that the system cannot know "Aladin" is title or 
category => It raises an error.
